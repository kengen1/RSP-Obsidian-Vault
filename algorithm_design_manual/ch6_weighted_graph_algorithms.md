# Chapter 6 : Weighted Graph Algorithms

## Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs)
- a Minimum Spanning Tree is a subgraph that connects all vertices of a graph with the minimum possible total edge weight, without forming cyclces
- MSTs are essential in applications where minimizing costs is crucial, such as:
    - designing networks
    - road systems
    - electrical circuits

### 1. Prim's Algorithm

### 2. Kruskal's Algorithm

### 3. Union-Set Data Structure


## Shortest Path Algorithms
- finds the minimum path or distance between nodes in a graph 
- usually done by using **edge-weights** representing costs, distances, or times
- commonly used in:
    - navigation systems
    - network routing protocols
    - scheduling and resource allocation

### 1. Dijkstra's Algorithm

### 2. Bellman-Ford Algorithm

### 3. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
