## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1014. Best Sightseeing Pair`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/best-sightseeing-pair/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Greedy #Dynamic-Programming 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- a brute force approach (with a TC of O(n^2)) would be to have a nested loop that calculates the score between two sightseeing spots, and keeps track of the highest value

- we need something more efficient than O(n^2), probably linear
- this problem seems similar to the problem 'best time to buy and sell stock'
- a greedy approach could work
