## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Greedy #Arrays 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- best to take a greedy approach where we only buy stock when we know that a profit can be made
- we can ignore potential trades that will incur a loss
- To maximize profit over multiple transactions, we aim to capture every upward price movement (whenever prices[i+1]>prices[i]prices[i+1] > prices[i]prices[i+1]>prices[i]).
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
To maximize profit over multiple transactions, we aim to capture every upward price movement (whenever prices[i+1]>prices[i]prices[i+1] > prices[i]prices[i+1]>prices[i]).
This is equivalent to summing up all positive differences between consecutive prices.
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
	int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
		int totalProfit = 0;

		for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
			if(prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
				totalProfit = prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
			}
		}
		
		return totalProfit;
	}
}
