## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `565. Array Nesting`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/array-nesting/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Arrays #DFS 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- every element in nums has to be between 0 and n-1
- return the starting element that forms the longest path across indices in the array
	- treating the problem as a graph or traversal problem should help
	- treat each "set" as a path in a graph, we go as far or deep as possible, recording the depth
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
~ the wording of the question is confusing in an interview setting
- defining the DFS lambda function 
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- use a visited array to keep track of indices that have already been part of a cycle 
	- this avoids recomputation of already encountered paths
- for every unvisited index, start a DFS traversal to explore the cycle 
- track the length of the current cycle during DFS and update the maximum length encountered
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n) each index is visited exactly once 
Space Complexity: O(n) due to the use of the visited boolean array
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int arrayNesting(vector<int>& nums) {
    
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<bool> visited (n, false);
        int maxLen = 0;

        auto dfs = [&](int start) -> int {
            int count = 0, index = start;
            
            while(!visited[index]) {
                visited[index] = true;
                index = nums[index];
                count++;
            }
            return count;
        };

        for(int i=0; i < n; i++) {
            maxLen = max(maxLen, dfs(i));
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
};
