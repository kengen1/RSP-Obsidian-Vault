## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- every element in nums has to be between 0 and n-1
- return the starting element that forms the longest path across indices in the array
	- treating the problem as a graph or traversal problem should help
	- treat each "set" as a path in a graph, we go as far or deep as possible, recording the depth
