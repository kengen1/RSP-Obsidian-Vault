## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1685. Sum of Absolute Difference in a Sorted Array`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-absolute-differences-in-a-sorted-array/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Math #Prefix-Sum #Arrays 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- brute force would be to calculate the cumulative sum over n^2 iterations
- interviewer pointed out that there is potentially a pattern in our caclulations that could help
- if we first calculate the sum of all elements, we can use a formula to do the absolute difference calculations in linear time 
- the input array is sorted in non-decreasing order

```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
~ my formula was wrong in the interview, was short on time 
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- precompute the total sum of the array
- divide and conquer : for each nums[i], split the array into two parts:
	- left part: sumLeft = the concatenation of nums[i] elements
	- right part: sumRight = totalSum - sumLeft - nums[i]
	- using sumLeft and sumRight, compute the sum of absolute differences
	- result[i] = i * nums[i] - sumLeft + sumRight - (n - i - 1) * nums[i]
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) for the use of the results vector 
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution
