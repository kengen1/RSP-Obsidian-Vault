## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
rules:
- alice and bob take turns picking a divisor x of n (where x is between 1 and n non-inclusive)
- the number n is updated to n - x
- if a player can't make a move, they lose
- alice always goes first

- Alice can *ALWAYS* win if n is even
	- alice can always leave bob with an odd n 
	- if n is odd, bob will always return n to even

	- when n is even
