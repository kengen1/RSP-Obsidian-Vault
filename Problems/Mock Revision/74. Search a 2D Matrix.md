## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `74. Search a 2D Matrix`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Arrays #Matrix #Binary-Search 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- brute force approach would be just iterating through every element in the matrix and checking if it equals our target value
	- this would be O(n*m) time, which is not acceptable for the constraint of it being O(log(m*n))

- the input matrix is sorted (this helps)
- a logarithmic solution for searching for an element would be some form of binary search
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- nailed this question in the mock, just ran out of time by like a minute due to spending too much time of the first question
