## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- my intuition for this problem was incorrect / bad so i will be omitting it here 
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
1. track frequency of zeros and ones

2. optimal split calculation (best)
	- the variable `best` keeps track of the maximum difference between zeros and ones up to any split point
	- this difference helps maximise the score after adding the count of 1s to the right part 

3. final adjustment (best + ones)
	- after completing the loop iteration, best represents the optimal score contribution from the left part
	- to compute the final score, we add all remaining 1s from the right part, to best
```
