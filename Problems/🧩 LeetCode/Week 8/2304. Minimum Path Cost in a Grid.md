## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `2304. Minimum Path Cost in a Grid`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-cost-in-a-grid
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** `{{tags/categories}}`

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- the grid make things seem different but this is essentially a graph question where nodes (elements in the matrix) have connected edges that are weighted (per the moveCost vector) 

- could explicitly construct a graph via an adjacency list out of these values, and then conduct dijkstras shortest path, returning the minCost of this path
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- explicitly constructing a graph would be inefficient
	- need a way of constructing the minCost without constructing a graph 
	- there is *something in the question that should allow us to do this*

- in a traditional graph, each node has the ability to connect to any other node in the graph
- this question outlines the rule that a node can only connect to nodes in the next row of the grid
	- this means we can break the problem down into subproblems
	  where the solution for row i is dependent only on row i - 1
