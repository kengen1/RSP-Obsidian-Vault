## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `2304. Minimum Path Cost in a Grid`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-cost-in-a-grid
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** `{{tags/categories}}`

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- the grid make things seem different but this is essentially a graph question where nodes (elements in the matrix) have connected edges that are weighted (per the moveCost vector) 

- could explicitly construct a graph via an adjacency list out of these values, and then conduct dijkstras shortest path, returning the minCost of this path
