## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `3184. Count Pairs That Form a Complete Day I`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-that-form-a-complete-day-i/
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Arrays #Math 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
simple / brute force approach is acceptable in this case since the max length of the array is 100
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```

```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- nested for loop that has i start at 0 and j start at i + 1
- check if the sum of nums[i] and nums[j] is a multiple of 24
- increment a counter variable and return it 
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countCompleteDayPairs(vector<int>& hours) {
        
        int count = 0;

        for(int i=0; i < hours.size(); i++) {
            for(int j = i+1; j < hours.size(); j++) {
                if ((hours[i] + hours[j]) % 24 == 0) count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```
