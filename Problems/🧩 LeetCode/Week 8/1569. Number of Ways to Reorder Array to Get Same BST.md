## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1569. Number of Ways to Reorder Array to Get Same BST`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-reorder-array-to-get-same-bst/
- **Difficulty:** #Hard 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Dynamic-Programming #DFS #Divide-and-Conquer #BST

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- elements are unique and between 1-1000
- tree is not self-balancing, therefore we dont need to worry about rebalancing in the event of insertion
- return the number of combinations as modulo 10^9+7

- the root of the tree always has to be the first element in the array, as it will determine the correctness of the left and right subtrees
	- need some kind of subproblem after the base case, which would be the insertion of the root node (starting element)
```
