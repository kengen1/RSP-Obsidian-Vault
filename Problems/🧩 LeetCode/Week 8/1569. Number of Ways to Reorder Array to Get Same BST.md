## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- elements are unique and between 1-1000
- tree is not self-balancing, therefore we dont need to worry about rebalancing in the event of insertion

- the root of the tree always has to be the first element in the array, as it will determine the correctness of the left and right subtrees
- every time we traverse down the tree, we need to ensure the insertion of the great
