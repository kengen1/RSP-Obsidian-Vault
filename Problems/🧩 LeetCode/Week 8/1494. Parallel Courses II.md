## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1494. Parallel Courses II`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/parallel-courses-ii/
- **Difficulty:** #Hard 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Graphs #Bitmask #Dynamic-Programming #Bit-Manipulation 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- explicitly construct a graph via an adjacency list since the number of possible nodes is small (1 - 15)
- also create a separate structure to store the degree weights for edges

- when solving the problem by hand, we look at how many relationships a given node has pointing to it, we can
compare that number with k using the modulo operator and get the remainder, this could be done recursively as there could be multiple semesters needed to be added before that unit is able to be compelted.

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- missing application of dp and bitmasking to this problem
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

### Bitmasking and DP
- using a graph to represent the problem is intuitive because prerequisites define a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**.
- however, the issue with explicitly managing states for large inputs is that the state space becomes so large that it is computationally infeasible

**Intuition for Bitmasking**
- each course can either be completed (`1`) or not (`0`), so we can represent the state of all courses using a single integer where the `i`th bit corresponds to whether course `i` has been completed
- we only need at most a single integer since the problem constraints define `1 <= n <= 15`
- if there are `n` courses, the total number of possible states is `2^n` (all combinations of completed/incomplete courses)

**Intuition for DP**
- let `dp[mask]` represent the minimum number of semesters required to complete the courses represented by `mask` (where `mask` is a bitmask).
  

```
- represent rerequsite courses as a directed graph using an adjacency list
- use bitmask DP to explore all subsets of courses that can be taken in parallel (subject to k constraints per semester)
- track the prerequisites of each course using a bitmask for efficient processing
