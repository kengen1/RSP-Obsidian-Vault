## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1494. Parallel Courses II`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/parallel-courses-ii/
- **Difficulty:** #Hard 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Graphs #Bitmask #Dynamic-Programming #Bit-Manipulation 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- explicitly construct a graph via an adjacency list since the number of possible nodes is small (1 - 15)
- also create a separate structure to store the degree weights for edges

- when solving the problem by hand, we look at how many relationships a given node has pointing to it, we can
compare that number with k using the modulo operator and get the remainder, this could be done recursively as there could be multiple semesters needed to be added before that unit is able to be compelted.
