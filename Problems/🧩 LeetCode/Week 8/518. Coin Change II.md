## üìù Problem Details

- **Title:** `518. Coin Change II`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/
- **Difficulty:**  #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Dynamic-Programming 

## üí≠What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- dynamic programming approach used to count the number of ways to make up the given `amount` using the available coins
- use a bottom-up approach
- iterate through the coins and update the number of ways to make every amount from the coin's value up to the target amount
- ensure all combinations are correctly considered
```

## ü§îWhat Did I Struggle With?

```
- initial implementation failed for larger test cases due to integer overflow when using the int datatype for the dp array
- C++ couldnt handle the large values generated during the summation for scenarios where the number of ways to form an amount was very high
- resolve the issue by using `uint64` for the dp array, avoiding overflow
```

## üí° Explanation of Solution

#### Key Idea
- use a DP array where `dp[x]` represents the number of ways to form amount `x` using the given coins
#### Recurrence Relation
`dp[x] = dp[x] + dp[x - coin[i]]`

- for each coin `coin[i]`
	- `include coin[i]` :  add the number of ways to form `x - coin[i]` (reuse of coins allowed)
	- `skip coin[i]`: keeps the number of ways to form `x` without using this coin 

#### Base Case
- `dp[0] = 1`: there is exactly one way to make the amount `0` - by using no coins
#### Steps
1. initialize a DP array of size `amount + 1` with all elements set to `0`
2. set `dp[0] = 1` to handle the base case
3. iterate through each coin and update the DP array for all amounts from the coin's value up to `amount`
4. return `dp[amount]` as the result

## ‚åõ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n * amount)
- iterates through each of the `n` coins, and for each coin, updates the DP array for all amounts from the coin's value to `amount`

Space Complexity: O(amount)
- the dp array stores the number of ways to make each amount up to `amount`
```

## üíª Implementation of Solution

```cpp
/*
Recurrence Relation Explanation:

For each coin coin[i], to make amount x:

- Include coin[i]: Add the number of ways to make x - coin[i] (reuse of coins allowed).
- Skip coin[i]: Use the number of ways to make x without this coin.

Thus, the recurrence relation is:

    dp[x] = dp[x] + dp[x - coin[i]]

Where:
    dp[x] is the number of ways to make amount x.
    dp[0] = 1 (1 way to make amount 0: use no coins).

We update dp[x] for each coin iteratively to count the number of ways to form the amount.

class Solution {
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        int n = coins.size();

        // Use a vector of uint64_t to avoid overflow for large test cases.
        vector<uint64_t> dp(amount + 1, 0);

        // Base case: There's 1 way to make the amount 0 (use no coins).
        dp[0] = 1;

        // Iterate through coins from the last to the first.
        for (int coin = n - 1; coin >= 0; coin--) {
            // For each coin, update the dp array for all target amounts.
            for (int target = coins[coin]; target <= amount; target++) {
                dp[target] += dp[target - coins[coin]];
            }
        }

        // The answer is the number of ways to make the amount.
        return dp[amount];
    }
};
