## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `518. Coin Change II`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/
- **Difficulty:**  #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Dynamic-Programming 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- dynamic programming approach used to count the number of ways to make up the given `amount` using the available coins
- use a bottom-up approach
- iterate through the coins and update the number of ways to make every amount from the coin's value up to the target amount
- ensure all combinations are correctly considered
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- initial implementation failed for larger test cases due to integer overflow when using the int datatype for the dp array
- C++ couldnt handle the large values generated during the summation for scenarios where the number of ways to form an amount was very high
- resolve the issue by using `uint64` for the dp array, avoiding overflow
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

#### Key Idea
- use a DP array where `dp[x]` represents the number of ways to form amount `x` using the given coins
#### Recurrence Relation
`dp[x] = dp[x] + dp[x - coin[i]]`

- for each coin `coin[i]`
	- `include coin[i]` :  add the number of ways to form `x - coin[i]` (reuse of coins allowed)
	- `skip coin[i]`: keeps the number of ways to form `x` without using this coin 

#### Base Case
- `dp[0] = 1`: there is exactly one way to make the amount `0` - by using no coins
#### Steps
1. initialize a DP array of size `amount + 1` with all elements set to `0`
2. set `dp[0] = 1` to handle the base case
3. iterate through each coin and update the DP array for all amounts from the coin's value up to `amount`
4. return `dp[amount]` as the result
