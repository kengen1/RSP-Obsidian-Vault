- **Title:** `2207. Maximize Number of Subsequences in a String`

- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Strings #Greedy #Prefix-Sum 

## 🔍 Problem Understanding

1. **Subsequences**:
	- a subsequence of a string is a sequence derived by deleting some or no characters of the string without changing the order of the remaining characters
	- e.g. `s = abd`, the subsequences include `a` `b` `c` `ab` `ac` `bc` `abc`

2. **Task**:
	- you are given string `text` and 2 characters inside string `pattern` (lets call them `x` and `y`)
	- the goal is the maximize the number of `xy` subsequences (where `x` comes before `y` in the string) by inserting one additional character (`x` or `y`) into the string

3. **Rules**:
	- you can only insert one character at a time: either `x` or `y`
	- the insertion can be done at any position in the string (even at the beginning or end )

4. **Objective**:
	- determine the maximum number of `xy` subsequences you can obtain after the insertion

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- **Track Existing Subsequence Counts**:
    - Use `cnt1` to count occurrences of `pattern[0]` as we iterate through the string.
    - Use `cnt2` to count occurrences of `pattern[1]`.

- **Update Subsequence Count**:    
    - If the current character is `pattern[0]`, increment `cnt1`.
    - If the current character is `pattern[1]`, it forms subsequences with all previous `pattern[0]` characters, so increment `cnt2` and add `cnt1` to the result.

- **Consider Adding a New Character**:    
    - If you add `pattern[0]`, place it at the beginning. This forms additional subsequences with every `pattern[1]`, so add `cnt2` to the result.
    - If you add `pattern[1]`, place it at the end. This forms additional subsequences with every `pattern[0]`, so add `cnt1` to the result.

- **Output the Maximum**:
    - Return the maximum of the existing subsequences and the two cases of adding a character.

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumSubsequenceCount(string text, string pattern) {
        long long count1 = 0;
        long long count2 = 0;
        long long result = 0;

        // calculate the current number of pattern subsequences
        for(char c : text) {
            if(c == pattern[1]) {

                // Each `pattern[1]` pairs with all previous `pattern[0]`
                result += count1;
                count2++; 
            }
            if(c == pattern[0]) {
                count1++;
            }
        }

        // consider adding one character
        long long addPattern0 = result + count2; // add pattern[0] at the start
        long long addPattern1 = result + count1; // add pattern[1] at the end

        return max({result, addPattern0, addPattern1});
    }
};
```
