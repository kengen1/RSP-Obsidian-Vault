## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `2207. Maximize Number of Subsequences in a String`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-number-of-subsequences-in-a-string/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Strings #Greedy #Prefix-Sum 


## 🔍 Problem Understanding

1. **Subsequences**:
	- a subsequence of a string is a sequence derived by deleting some or no characters of the string without changing the order of the remaining characters
	- e.g. `s = abd`, the subsequences include `a` `b` `c` `ab` `ac` `bc` `abc`

2. **Task**:
	- you are given string `text` and 2 characters inside string `pattern` (lets call them `x` and `y`)
	- the goal is the maximize the number of `xy` subsequences (where `x` comes before `y` in the string) by inserting one additional character (`x` or `y`) into the string

3. **Rules**:
	- you can only insert one character at a time: either `x` or `y`
	- the insertion can be done at any position in the string (even at the beginning or end )

4. **Objective**:
	- determine the maximum number of `xy` subsequences you can obtain after the insertion


**Example**:
- input:  `s = "abdc"
- pattern: `x = "a"  y = "d"`
