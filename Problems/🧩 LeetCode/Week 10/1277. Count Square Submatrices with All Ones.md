## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1277. Count Square Submatrices with All Ones`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-submatrices-with-all-ones/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Dynamic-Programming #Arrays #Matrix 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
naive approach:
- count all individual 1s
- count all 2x2 matrices
- count all 3x3 matrics 
- etc.

- repeatedly going through the array to find these submatrices of varying sizes is inefficient algorithmically 
- can probably break this down into a subproblem
