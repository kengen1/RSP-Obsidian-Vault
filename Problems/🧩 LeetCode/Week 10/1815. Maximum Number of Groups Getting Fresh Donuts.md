## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- how to reduce problem space 
- how to determine order of groups to serve
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

#### 1. Reduce Problem Space

- instead of tracking the exact number of people in each group, track the remainder when divided by `batchSize`
- this reduces the possible groups from 30 (max input) to just `batchSize` <= 9

#### 2. Greedy Matching Strategy

- start by counting groups where `group % batchSize == 0`, as they are always "happy"
- then, greedily pair groups `(A,B)` such that `(A + B) % batchSize == 0` to maximize the number of happy groups
- this effectively reduces the number of unpaired remainders

#### 3. Dynamic Programming for Remaining Groups

- after apply the greedy approach, there will most likely be some groups remaining
- since larger combinations can be formed in multiple ways, use **backtracking memoization** (DP) to find the optimal way to combine them
- the number of remaining groups is small, making DP efficient

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n^b), where n is the number of groups and b is batchSize
- the greedy utilisation reduces b to b/2, which is not significant for the complexity analysis

Space Complexity: O(b)
- to store counts
```
