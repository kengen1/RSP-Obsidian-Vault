## 💡 Explanation of Solution

#### 1. Reduce Problem Space

- instead of tracking the exact number of people in each group, track the remainder when divided by `batchSize`
- this reduces the possible groups from 30 (max input) to just `batchSize` <= 9

#### 2. Greedy Matching Strategy

- start by counting groups where `group % batchSize == 0`, as they are always "happy"
- then, greedily pair groups `(A,B)` such that `(A + B) % batchSize == 0` to maximize the number of happy groups
- this effectively reduces the number of unpaired remainders

#### 3. Dynamic Programming for Remaining Groups
