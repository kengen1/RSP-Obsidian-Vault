## ü§îWhat Did I Struggle With?

```
- how to reduce problem space 
- how to determine order of groups to serve
```

## üí° Explanation of Solution

#### 1. Reduce Problem Space

- instead of tracking the exact number of people in each group, track the remainder when divided by `batchSize`
- this reduces the possible groups from 30 (max input) to just `batchSize` <= 9

#### 2. Greedy Matching Strategy

- start by counting groups where `group % batchSize == 0`, as they are always "happy"
- then, greedily pair groups `(A,B)` such that `(A + B) % batchSize == 0` to maximize the number of happy groups
- this effectively reduces the number of unpaired remainders

#### 3. Dynamic Programming for Remaining Groups

- after apply the greedy approach, there will most likely be some groups remaining
- since larger combinations can be formed in multiple ways, use **backtracking memoization** (DP) to find the optimal way to combine them
- the number of remaining groups is small, making DP efficient

## ‚åõ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n^b), where n is the number of groups and b is batchSize
- the greedy utilisation reduces b to b/2, which is not significant for the complexity analysis

Space Complexity: O(b)
- to store counts
```

## üíª Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    unordered_map<vector<int>, int> dp;  // Memoization: Stores already computed results
public:
    // DFS function to maximize happy groups with backtracking and memoization
    int dfs(vector<int>& remainderCounts, int remainder) {
        // Check if the result for this state has already been computed
        auto it = dp.find(remainderCounts);
        if (it != dp.end())
            return it->second;

        int maxHappyGroups = 0;
        int batchSize = remainderCounts.size();

        // Try serving a group from each remainder category (except remainder 0)
        for (int i = 1; i < batchSize; ++i) {
            if (remainderCounts[i] > 0) {  // If there are groups with remainder `i`
                --remainderCounts[i];  // Use one such group
                // Calculate new remainder and count happy group if remainder becomes zero
                maxHappyGroups = max(maxHappyGroups, (remainder == 0) + dfs(remainderCounts, (batchSize + remainder - i) % batchSize));
                ++remainderCounts[i];  // Backtrack (undo the change)
            }
        }

        // Store the result in dp and return
        return dp[remainderCounts] = maxHappyGroups;
    }

    int maxHappyGroups(int batchSize, vector<int>& groups) {
        vector<int> remainderCounts(batchSize, 0);  // Store counts of remainders
        int happyGroups = 0;

        // Greedy Step: Directly count groups that are already happy
        for (int groupSize : groups) {
            int remainder = groupSize % batchSize;
            if (remainder == 0) {
                ++happyGroups;  // Group is happy as is
            } else if (remainderCounts[batchSize - remainder] > 0) {
                --remainderCounts[batchSize - remainder];  // Pair with complementary remainder
                ++happyGroups;
            } else {
                ++remainderCounts[remainder];  // Store for future pairing
            }
        }

        // Use DFS + Memoization to maximize additional happy groups
        return dfs(remainderCounts, 0) + happyGroups;
    }
};
```
