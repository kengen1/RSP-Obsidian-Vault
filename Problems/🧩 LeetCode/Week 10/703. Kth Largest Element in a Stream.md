## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Design #Priority-Queue #Min-Heap

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- naive approach would be to sort the list upon each operation
- can use a min heap / priority queue to maintain the order of elements as we add new values 
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```

```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- maintain a priority queue of size k
- during initialization , we iterate through the given list and add elements to the heap using the `add` function
- if the heap exceeds size k, remove the smallest element
