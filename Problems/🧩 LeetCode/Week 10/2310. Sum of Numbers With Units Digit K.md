## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
1. check smallest contribution first
	- start with the smallest value k (as term 1)
	- if num is already divisible by k, return 1

2. try multiples of 10
	- start with k, then try 10 + k, 20 + k, 30 + k ....
	- if at any point the remaining sum (num - x) is divisible by 10, we have found a valid solution
	- keep track of the minimum number of terms

3. terminate early 
	- since we only need numbers <= num, we stop when we surpass num
