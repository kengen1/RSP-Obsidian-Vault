## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `2009. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Contiguous`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-continuous/
- **Difficulty:** #Hard 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Arrays

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- removing duplicates by inserting each unique element into a ordered hashset, incrementing our operations counter each time an element is NOT placed in the set 
- we should be able to take the largest and smallest value in the hashset and check if its valid (abs(maxElement, minElement) == size of hashset-1 
- if its not equal, then do *something*
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
~ we could probably just sort the list of elements instead of using the ordered set, reducing the number of hashmap operations
