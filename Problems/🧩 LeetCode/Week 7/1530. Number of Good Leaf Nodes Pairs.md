- **Title:** `1530. Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-leaf-nodes-pairs/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Trees #DFS #BFS #Graphs 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- determining the shortest path between leaf nodes 
- if we are finding the shortest path within a distance param, the problem could be converted into a graph problem

- if we want to keep it as a tree problem, conducting a dfs to leaf nodes is the first thing to do some sort of secondary traversal from a leaf node to the closest next leaf node is needed
	- prune the nested traversal if it exceeds the distance counter
	- recurse back to the original leaf node once we finish the nested traversal and continue our DFS to the next leaf node (this can be optimised)
	- return the counter after DFS is finished
- this is too inefficient and will cause TLE
