## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1379. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-corresponding-node-of-a-binary-tree-in-a-clone-of-that-tree/
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Trees 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- if the node values are unique, then we don't exactly need to care about the contents of the original tree
- we can do a DFS traversal with a helper function, passing through the root of the cloned tree, and the value of the target node, once we find the target node, return it 
```
