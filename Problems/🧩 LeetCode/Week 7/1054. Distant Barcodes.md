- **Title:** `1054. Distant Barcodes`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/distant-barcodes/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Hashmap #Priority-Queue #Arrays

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- create a frequency map for all integers in the barcodes array 
- and then sequentially search each element into the array until there is no more available element for that particular value
- however this doesnt take into account the fact that if an element has a higher frequency than others, it will have adjacent elements at the end of this new array. 
- maybe this solution involves a greedy approach, where we greedily choose the element from the hashmap with the highest frequency, that is not equal to the last element in our new array

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- create a frequency map for the occurrence of integers in the barcodes array
- create a priority queue to store a pairs of integers (representing the value and freq)
	- insert each element in the map into the priority queue

- while the q is not empty
	- get the top element, pop it from the queue
	- push the value into the result 
	- reduce the frequency by 1
	- push
