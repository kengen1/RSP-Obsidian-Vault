- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-with-swaps/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Union-Find 

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- graph representation of the problem 
- understanding the disjoint sets approach to the problem
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

### Visualizing the Problem as a Graph Problem
* **Nodes:** each index of string `s` is representing as a node 
* **Edges:** each pair `[i,j]` is an edge between nodes `i` and `j`, indicating that characters at these indices can be swapped 
* **Connected Components:** All indices that are connected directly or indirectly through edges form a **connected component**
	* Within each connected component, you can freely rearrange the characters

#### Identifying Disjoint Sets in the Graph
- a **Disjoint Set** ([[Union-Find (Disjoint Set)]]) is a collection of indices that belong to the same connected component in the graph
	- these sets represent groups of indices where swaps can occur

### Algorithm Design

```
- graph representation
	- treat indices of the string as nodes and pairs as edges to form an undirected graph

- find connected components
	- ue union-find to efficiently group indicies into connected components

- collect and sort characters
	- for each connected component, collect the characters from the string corresponding to the indices
	- sort the characters lexicographically

- reassign sorted characters
	- map the sorted characters back to the corresponding indices in the string 
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- sorting characters within components takes O(n log n)
- disjoint set operations 
	- initialising parent and rank structures takes O(n)
	- union operation is O(α(n)) where α is the inverse ackermann function (almost constant)

Space Complexity: O(n)
- storage of indices in the disjoint set --> O(n)
- storage of connected components in a hashmap --> O(n)
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
```cpp
class UnionFind {
private:
    vector<int> parent; // stores the parent of each element
    vector<int> rank;   // stores the rank(depth) of each set

public:
    // constructor initializes n elements with each element being its own parent
    UnionFind(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        rank.resize(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;  // Initially, each element is its own root
        }
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);  // Path compression
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    void unionSets(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);

        if (rootX != rootY) {
            // Union by Rank
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX] += 1;
            }
        }
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    string smallestStringWithSwaps(string s, vector<vector<int>>& pairs) {
        int n = s.size();
        UnionFind uf(n);

        // step 1: union nodes based on pairs
        for(const auto& pair : pairs) {
            uf.unionSets(pair[0], pair[1]);
        }

        // step 2: group indices by their connected component
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> components;
        for(int i=0; i < n; i++) {
            components[uf.find(i)].push_back(i);
        }

        // step 3: sort characters within each connected component
        for(auto& [root, indices] : components) {
            // collect characters
            string chars;
            for(int index : indices) {
                chars += s[index];
            }

            // sort characters
            sort(chars.begin(), chars.end());

            // reassign sorted characters back to their positions
            sort(indices.begin(), indices.end());

            for(int i=0; i < indices.size(); i++) {
                s[indices[i]] = chars[i];
            }
        }
        return s;
    }
