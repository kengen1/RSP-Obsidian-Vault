## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- graph representation of the problem 
- understanding the disjoint sets approach to the problem
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

### Visualizing the Problem as a Graph Problem
* **Nodes:** each index of string `s` is representing as a node 
* **Edges:** each pair `[i,j]` is an edge between nodes `i` and `j`, indicating that characters at these indices can be swapped 
* **Connected Components:** All indices that are connected directly or indirectly through edges form a **connected component**
	* Within each connected component, you can freely rearrange the characters
