## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

Was unable to come up with the graph interpretation
### Intuition for BFS:
**1. Problem Representation**:
- each gene (string) can be seen as a node
- a valid single-char mutation transforms one gene into another, forming an **edge** between two nodes
- the task is to find the shortest path from the `startGene` to the `endGene` through this graph, where the valid genes are in the bank

**2. Layered Exploration**:
- BFS explores all nodes (mutations) at the same "distance" (i.e. single mutation steps) before moving to nodes further away.
- This ensures that when you reach `endGene`, you've found the shortest path possible 

**3. Efficiency / Optimization**:
- BFS avoids revisiting already-explored genes (nodes), reducing redundant computation
- By storing valid genes in a set (or hashmap), we can quickly check if a gene is part of the bank 

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
BFS Approach:

1. init
	- create a queue of pairs, starting with the startGene and an initial mutation count of 0
	- create a set representation of genes in bank
	- create a set for visited to avoid redundant computation

2. iterative exploration
	- while the queue is not empty
		- deque the current gene and its mutation count 
		- for each character position in the current gene
			- replace the character with one of the three other possible characters [A, C, G, T]
			- generate a new gene (potential neighbour)
			- if the new gene matches endGene, return the mutation count + 1
			- if the new gene exists in the bank and has been visited:
				- mark it as visited
				- enqueue the new gene with the updated mutation count

3. termination
	- if the queue is empty and endGene hasn't been reached, return -1 (no valid mutation path exists)
