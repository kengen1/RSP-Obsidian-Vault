## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

Was unable to come up with the graph interpretation
### Intuition for BFS:
**1. Problem Representation**:
- each gene (string) can be seen as a node
- a valid single-char mutation transforms one gene into another, forming an **edge** between two nodes
- the task is to find the shortest path from the `startGene` to the `endGene` through this graph, where the valid genes are in the bank

**2. Layered Exploration**:
- BFS explores all nodes (mutations) at the same "distance" (i.e. single mutation steps) before moving to nodes further away.
- This ensures that when you reach `endGene`, you've found the shortest path possible 

**3. Efficiency / Optimization**:
- BFS avoids revisiting already-explored genes (nodes), reducing redundant computation
- By storing valid genes in a set (or hashmap), we can quickly check if a gene is part of the bank
