## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `2980. Check if Bitwise OR Has Trailing Zeros`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-bitwise-or-has-trailing-zeros/
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Bit-Manipulation #Arrays 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- brute force approach and naive would be to check every combination of integers of size 2 - n to see if they have a trailing zero in their binary representation

- since we are looking for the binary representation of a value, theres most likley a pattern to when trailing zeros appear
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```

```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- we only need to know if there are at least 2 even integers in the array
- performing the logical OR operation on 2 even integers is garunteed to return a value with a leading zero
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasTrailingZeros(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;

        for(int num : nums) {
            if(num % 2 == 0) count++;
            if(count == 2) return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```
