## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `563. Binary Tree Tilt`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-tilt/
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Trees #DFS 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- dfs 
- need to find the *sum of every tree node's tilt*
	- tilt = abs between the sum of all nodes in the left subtree and nodes in the right subtree
	- if a node does not have a left or right child, treat the sum as a 0
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
~ helper function was required for this problem, could solve wiht DFS in the singular function
