## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- resetting the window at the correct position to account for multiple start indexes inside a window
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- create a hashmap wordCount to store the frequency of each word in the given list of words 
- calculate the length of each word (wordLength)
- calculate the total concatenated length of all words (substringLength = wordLength * words.size())

- iterate over start points
	- since the words have fixed lengths, iterate the string in wordLength chunks using indices i in range 0 - words.size()

- sliding window 
	- use two pointers , start and end, to maintain a sliding window of length equal to substringLength
	- track words within the window using a hashmap currentCount

- expand the window
