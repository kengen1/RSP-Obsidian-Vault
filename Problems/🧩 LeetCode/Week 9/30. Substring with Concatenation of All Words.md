## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- resetting the window at the correct position to account for multiple start indexes inside a window
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- create a hashmap wordCount to store the frequency of each word in the given list of words 
- calculate the length of each word (wordLength)
- calculate the total concatenated length of all words (substringLength = wordLength * words.size())

- iterate over start points
	- since the words have fixed lengths, iterate the string in wordLength chunks using indices i in range 0 - words.size()

- sliding window 
	- use two pointers , start and end, to maintain a sliding window of length equal to substringLength
	- track words within the window using a hashmap currentCount

- expand the window 
	- slide end by wordLength chunks, extract the word in the substring, and check:
		- if the word is in wordCount, add it to the currentCount and check:
			- if currentCount[word] > wordCount[word], it means there's an extra word, so shrink the window from start until the condition is valid
			- if end - start == substring.size(), store start as a valid index 
		- if the word is not in wordCount, reset currentCount and move start to end 

- adjust start for overlaps:
	- if an invalid word is found or the window size exceeds substring.size(), move the start to end and reset the currentCount

- collect results:
	- append valid start indices to the result list
