## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1981. Minimize the Difference Between Target and Chosen Elements`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-difference-between-target-and-chosen-elements/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Dynamic-Programming #Matrix  

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- solved a similar problem that involved a 1 dimensional matrix
	- was able to be solved with a sliding window approach
	- this problem involved a 2D matrix where a value from each row needs to be selected
- initially thought maybe a greedy approach could work
	- choose the smallest element from each row 
	- this potentially locks us into a poor choice in later rows that might benefit from a better previous choice

- since we are dependent on the choices made so far to inform the choice of value in the current row, dynamic programming with caching would best suit this problem
