## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `54. Spiral Matrix`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Matrix #Arrays 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- things to address:
	- switching between row and column movement
	- switching between forward and backward directions
	- changes in boundaries as we spiral inward

- potential solution [WRONG]:
	- potentially keep an unodered_set of elements traversed in the matrix
	- if the next element exists in the set, rotate early
	- if we have hit a boundary, rotate

	- above proposed solution doesnt take into account duplicate elements in the matrix
	- also space inefficient
