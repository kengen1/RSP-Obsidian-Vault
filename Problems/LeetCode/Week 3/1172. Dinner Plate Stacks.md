## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1172. Dinner Plate Stacks`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/24-game/
- **Difficulty:** #Hard 
- **Tags/Categories:**  #Hashmap #Stack #Design 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- private class members for:
	- capacity
	- vector of stacks to allow for infinite addition of stacks
	- need a way of tracking available positions in the event of popAtStack
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- coming up with the idea to use a set to track available positions 
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
capacity tracking:
	- store the capacity as a private class member so all methods can access it 

vector of stacks:
	- use a vector<stack<int>> to allow for dynamically expanding stacks 

track available stacks:
	- to optimize the push function, track the first available stack that can take a new value 
	- this can be achieved using a set<int> of indicies for non-full stacks
	- this ensures push remains efficient 

track active stacks:
	- for the pop function, track non-empty stacks 
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
O(log N) for push
O(log N) for popAtStack 
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
