## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `679. 24 Game`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/24-game/
- **Difficulty:** #Hard 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Math 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
brute force approach:
- generate all permutations of the four numbers
- try all possible combinations of operation (+,-,*,/) between them 
- this would  be exponential in time complexity (not very efficient)

- could implement pruning to remove redundant calculations
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- was unsure how to implement backtracking 
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
1. Input
	- four numbers
	- operations : +, -, *, /

2. Base Case:
	- if there is only one number left, check if it approximately equal to 24. If so, then return true

3. Recursive Step:
	- select two numbers from the list
	- apply each operation (+, -, *, /) to them
	- replace the two numbers with the result and recurse on the reduced list

4. Backtracking:
	- undo the operatoin and try another pair/operation
	- continue until all possibilities are exhausted 

5. Pruning:
	- skip division by zero
	- skip redundant cases, such as swapping the order of identical (e.g. 3+5 and 5+3)

6. Result:
	- if any recursive path leads to 24, return true
	- if no path, returns false
