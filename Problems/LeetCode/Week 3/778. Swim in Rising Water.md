## 🧪Problem Description

```
You are given an n x n grid of integers
Each cell in the grid represents the elevation of the land at that cell
The objective is to determine the minimum time T such that you can swim from the top-left cell (0,0) to the bottom right cell (n-1, n-1), assuming:
	1. At time T, you can swim in any cell whose elevation <= T
	2. You can move up, down, left or right from one cell to another

```

## 🔭Key Observations

```
1. Elevation as a Constraint:
- you can only move into a cell if T >= elevation[cell]
- at time T, all cells with elevation <= T are "accessible"

2. Goal:
- minimize T, so you reach (n-1, n-1) with the smallest possible elevation threshold

3. Pathfinding:
- you are essentially trying to find a path from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1) where the maximum elevation you encounter on the path is minimized

# 💡 *Approach 1* : Dijkstra's Algorithm

```
treat the problem as a graph traversal problem, where each cell is a node, and the elevation acts as the "cost" to enter the cell

- use a priority queue (min-heap) to explore the grid
- at each step, process the cell with the lowest elevation first
- track the maximum elevation encountered so far to reach each cell
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
TC: O(n^2 log n), since each of the n^2 cells is processed and pushed into the priority queue

^ this is an improvement over the brute force approach which warrants an exponential time complexity O(2^n)
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp

```

# 💡 *Approach 2* : Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

```
treat the grid as a set of connected components, where the idea is to progressively "flood" the grid by increasing T, connecting accessible cells into a single component

- sort all the cells by their elevation
- gradually process the cells in increasing order of elevation, connecting them to their neighbours using a union-find data structure
- stop when (0,0) and (n-1, n-1) belong to the same connected component

```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
TC: O(n^2 α (n^2)), where α is the inverse ackermann function (nearly constant in practice)
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
