## 🧪Problem Description

```
You are given an n x n grid of integers
Each cell in the grid represents the elevation of the land at that cell
The objective is to determine the minimum time T such that you can swim from the top-left cell (0,0) to the bottom right cell (n-1, n-1), assuming:
	1. At time T, you can swim in any cell whose elevation <= T
	2. You can move up, down, left or right from one cell to another

```

## 🔭Key Observations

```
1. Elevation as a Constraint:
- you can only move into a cell if T >= elevation[cell]
- at time T, all cells with elevation <= T are "accessible"

2. Goal:
- minimize T, so you reach (n-1, n-1) with the smallest possible elevation threshold

3. Pathfinding:
- you are essentially trying to find a path from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1) where the maximum elevation you encounter on the path is minimized

```

# 💡 *Approach 1* : Dijkstra's Algorithm

```
treat the problem as a graph traversal problem, where each cell is a node, and the elevation acts as the "cost" to enter the cell

- use a priority queue (min-heap) to explore the grid
- at each step, process the cell with the lowest elevation first
- track the maximum elevation encountered so far to reach each cell
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: 
O(n^2 log n), since each of the n^2 cells is processed and pushed into the priority queue
^ this is an improvement over the brute force approach which warrants an exponential time complexity O(2^n)

Space Compleixty:
O(n^2) for the auxilary space of the priority queue and the visited array

```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {

private:
    const vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    
public:
    int swimInWater(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
   
        int n = grid.size();

        // priority queue: {max elevation on path, row, col}
        priority_queue<tuple<int,int,int>, vector<tuple<int,int,int>>, greater<>> pq;

        // visited array to avoid revisiting cells
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(n, vector<bool>(n, false));

        // push the starting cell (0,0) into the priority queue
        pq.emplace(grid[0][0], 0,0);
        visited[0][0] = true;

        // explore the grid
        while(!pq.empty()) {
            auto [current_max, row, col] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
  
            // if we reach the bottom-right corner, return the current max elevation
            if(row == n-1 && col == n-1)
                return current_max;

            // explore all 4 possible directions
            for(const auto& [dx, dy] : directions) {
                int newRow = row + dx;
                int newCol = col + dy;
  
                // check bounds and if the cell is already visited
                if(newRow >= 0 && newRow < n
                && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n
                && !visited[newRow][newCol]) {
                    visited[newRow][newCol] = true;
                    // add the new cell to the queue qith the updated max elevation
                    pq.emplace(max(current_max, grid[newRow][newCol]), newRow, newCol);
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

# 💡 *Approach 2* : Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

```
treat the grid as a set of connected components, where the idea is to progressively "flood" the grid by increasing T, connecting accessible cells into a single component

- sort all the cells by their elevation
- gradually process the cells in increasing order of elevation, connecting them to their neighbours using a union-find data structure
- stop when (0,0) and (n-1, n-1) belong to the same connected component

```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
TC: O(n^2 α (n^2)), where α is the inverse ackermann function (nearly constant in practice)
```
