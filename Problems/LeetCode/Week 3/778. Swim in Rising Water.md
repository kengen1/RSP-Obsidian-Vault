## 🧪Problem Description

```
You are given an n x n grid of integers
Each cell in the grid represents the elevation of the land at that cell
The objective is to determine the minimum time T such that you can swim from the top-left cell (0,0) to the bottom right cell (n-1, n-1), assuming:
	1. At time T, you can swim in any cell whose elevation <= T
	2. You can move up, down, left or right from one cell to another

```

## 🔭Key Observations

```
1. Elevation as a Constraint: you can only
