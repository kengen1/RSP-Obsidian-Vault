## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `2331. Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree`
- **Link:** Problem Link
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Trees 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- a dfs recursive traversal if the current node is nullptr
- return *something* go up the call stack to the leaf node
- check the left and right child true / false values and compute the boolean value based on the current nodes AND/OR value 
- return the result up the call stack 
- keep going until we have traversd the tree
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
~ should stop at the left node rather than recursively reaching a nullptr node
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
Recursive DFS:
    - Start at the root of the tree.
    - For each node, recursively evaluate its left and right children.

Base Case:    
    - If the current node is a leaf node (i.e., both children are `nullptr`), return the value of the node itself (either `true` or `false`).

Recursive Case:    
    - If the current node is an operator (`AND` or `OR`), recursively evaluate its left and right subtrees to get their boolean values.
    - Compute the result based on the operator:
        - If the node represents `OR` (value `2`), return `left OR right`.
        - If the node represents `AND` (value `3`), return `left AND right`.

Continue Up the Call Stack:
    - Return the computed boolean value to the parent node until the entire tree is evaluated.

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool evaluateTree(TreeNode* root) {
        // Base case: If the node is a leaf, return its value
        if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr) {
            return root->val; // Leaf node (0 or 1 represents false or true)
        }

        // Recursive case: Evaluate left and right subtrees
        bool left = evaluateTree(root->left);
        bool right = evaluateTree(root->right);

        // Compute the result based on the operator
        if (root->val == 2) { // OR operator
            return left || right;
        } else if (root->val == 3) { // AND operator
            return left && right;
        }

        // Default case (should never occur in a valid input)
        return false;
    }
};
