## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- the number of piles is even
- the total number of stones in all the piles is odd
- since alice can choose first every time, she can choose either the first or last pile
	- this allows her to dictate the subset of piles available to bob in subsequent moves
- because of this, Alice technically will always win, and the solution can just have a return true statement
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
~ probably wouldve struggled with the DP approach, but the loophole in the question meant no issues with submission
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution (Dynamic Programming)

```
1. define the state
	- let dp[i][j] represent the maximum score difference that the current player can achieve over the opponent, assuming the stones to pick are in the range [i,j]
		- a positive value means the current player is ahead by that much
		- a negative value means the opponent is ahead by that much

2. base case:
	- if i == j (only 1 pile remains), alice can choose that pile
	- dp[i][j] = piles[i]

3. recurrence relation:
	- for each subarray [i,j] the current player can either:
		- take the left pile (piles[i]): the opponent will then play optimally for the new range [i+1][j]
		- take the right pile (piles[j]): the opponent will then play optimally for the new range [i][j-1]
		- therefore:
				dp[i][j] = max(piles[i] - dp[i+1][j], piles[j] - dp[i][j-1])
			
			- piles[i] - dp[i+1][j]: the player picks piles[i] and subtracts the score difference the opponent can achieve for [i+1][j]
			- piles[j] - dp[i][j-1]: the player piclks piles[j] and subtracts the score difference the opponent can achieve for [i][j-1]

4. final result:
	- the result is stored in dp[0][n-1], where n is the number of piles. If dp[0][n-1] > 0, Alice has a winning strategy
