## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- the number of piles is even
- the total number of stones in all the piles is odd
- since alice can choose first every time, she can choose either the first or last pile
	- this allows her to dictate the subset of piles available to bob in subsequent moves
- because of this, Alice technically will always win, and the solution can just have a return true statement
