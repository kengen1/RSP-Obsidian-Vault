## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `643. Maximum Average Subarray I`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** `{{tags/categories}}`

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- cant sort it since the subarray needs to be contiguous 
- having a fixed size sliding window of size k would allow us to traverse and calculate averages for elements in a contiguous subarray
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
same as initial thoughts ^
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double findMaxAverage(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int window_sum = 0;

        // Compute the sum of the first window
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            window_sum += nums[i];
        }

        // Initialize max average with the first window's average
        double maxAverage = static_cast<double>(window_sum) / k;

        // Slide the window across the array
        for (int i = k; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            window_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]; // Update the window sum
            maxAverage = max(maxAverage, static_cast<double>(window_sum) / k); // Update max average
        }

        return maxAverage;
    }
};
