## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
bool carPooling(vector<vector<int>>& trips, int capacity) {
    map<int, int> diff; // Difference array

    // Build the difference map
    for (auto &trip : trips) {
        int numPassengers = trip[0];
        int start = trip[1];
        int end   = trip[2];

        diff[start] += numPassengers; // Picking up passengers
        diff[end]   -= numPassengers; // Dropping off passengers
    }

    // Track current number of passengers
    int currentPassengers = 0;

    // Traverse locations in ascending order
    for (auto &kv : diff) {
        currentPassengers += kv.second;  // Update current passengers
        if (currentPassengers > capacity) {
            return false; // Capacity exceeded
        }
    }

    return true; // Capacity never exceeded
}
