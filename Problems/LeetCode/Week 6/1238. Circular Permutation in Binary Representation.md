## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
what is gray code?

- binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit
- this means if you list all the gray codes in an order, you get a sequence such that each value differs from the next by exactly one bit

a common formula to get the i-th gray code for n bits is :
		g(i)=i⊕(i≫1)
where ⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator, and ≫ is the right-shift operator.
