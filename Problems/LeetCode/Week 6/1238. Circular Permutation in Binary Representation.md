## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
what is gray code?

- binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit
- this means if you list all the gray codes in an order, you get a sequence such that each value differs from the next by exactly one bit

a common formula to get the i-th gray code for n bits is :
		g(i)=i⊕(i≫1)
where ⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator, and ≫ is the right-shift operator.
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
1. generate all gray codes for n bits 
	- we know 2^n is the total number of codes we need
	- for each integer i from 0 to size-1, compute its gray code using i⊕(i≫1)
	- store these gray codes in a vector `gray`

2. identify the starting index of the given start value
	- look through the generated gray codes to find which index corresponds to the integer start 

3.rotate the gray code sequence so it starts at `start`
	- once we know where start is, we take all gray codes from startIndex onward, wrap around circularly, and store them in result
	- the modulo % size ensures circular wrapping, if we go beyond the end of the array

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> circularPermutation(int n, int start) {
        int size = 1 << n;   // 2^n
        vector<int> gray(size);

        // 1) Generate Gray code: g(i) = i ^ (i >> 1)
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            gray[i] = i ^ (i >> 1);
        }

        // 2) Find the index of 'start' in the Gray code
        int startIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            if (gray[i] == start) {
                startIndex = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        // 3) Rotate the Gray code to begin at 'start'
        vector<int> result(size);
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            result[i] = gray[(startIndex + i) % size];
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
