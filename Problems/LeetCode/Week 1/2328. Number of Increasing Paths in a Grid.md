- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-increasing-paths-in-a-grid/
- **Difficulty:** #Hard 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Dynamic-Programming #Memoization #DFS #Arrays #Matrix #Graphs 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- DFS that recursively stores growing / increasing paths incrementally into a paths vector
- restart the path when curr > next node 
- return the size of the paths vector
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- formulating my "restarting of a new path"
	- each DFS call can be implicitly thought of as a new path without needing to separate restart logic
- having a paths vector is too computationally inefficient if the grid is large
	- directly counting the number of paths during DFS is the correct approach
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
1. Memo Table
	- the memo table is initialized to -1 to indicate uncomputed cells
	- memo[i][j] stores thte total number of increasing paths starting from cell (i,j)

2. MOD Value
	- since the input can be very large, paths are computed modulo 10^9 + 7 to avoid integer overflow

3. DFS Logic:
	- explore all four directions from the current cell
	- only move to a neighbouring cell if its value is greater than the current cell (ensures strictly increasing)

4. Final Calculation
	- after performing DFS for all cells, the sym of all values in the memo table gives the tital number of increasing paths
```
