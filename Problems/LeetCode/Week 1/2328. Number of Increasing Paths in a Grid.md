## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `2328. Number of Increasing Paths in a Grid`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-increasing-paths-in-a-grid/
- **Difficulty:** #Hard 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Dynamic-Programming #Memoization #DFS #Arrays #Matrix #Graphs 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- DFS that recursively stores growing / increasing paths incrementally into a paths vector
- restart the path when curr > next node 
- return the size of the paths vector
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- formulating my "restarting of a new path"
	- each DFS call can be implicitly thought of as a new path without needing to separate restart logic
- having a paths vector is too computationally inefficient if the grid is large
	- directly counting the number of paths during DFS is the correct approach
```
