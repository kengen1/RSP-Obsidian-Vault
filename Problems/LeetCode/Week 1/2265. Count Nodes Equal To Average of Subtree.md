## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `2265. Count Nodes Equal To Average of Subtree`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-nodes-equal-to-average-of-subtree/description/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Trees #Recursion 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- we need a way of traversing the tree
- throughout this traversal we need to track and compare the value of a node and the average of its subtree
- we also need a counter that can be maintained throughout traversal for the number of nodes that meet our criteria
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- how do implement a recursive solution that can keep track of our above criteria
- i was using the incorrect traversal method
	- i was trying to make an in-order traversal method work in a case where it wasn't appropriate
	- 
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
1. Postorder Traversal: Recursively process left and right subtrees before the current node

2. Subtree Calculation: Compute the sum and count of nodes for each subtree

3. Condition Check: Compare the node's value to the average of its subtree and update the count if they match

```
## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
