## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
1. Transaction definition: A transaction consists of ony buy and one sell, and you can make at most k transactions

2. Special Case for Large k : if k is greater than or equal to half the number of days, you can trade as much as you want, simplifying the problem to capturing all upward price movements

3. Dynamic Programming for Limited k: when k is small, use dynamic programming to compute the maximum profit
