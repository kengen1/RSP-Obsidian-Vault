## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1309. Decrypt String from Alphabet to Integer`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/decrypt-string-from-alphabet-to-integer-mapping/
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Strings 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- we need a way of determining whether a character is mapped to a single or double digit
- mind first went to using stoi and then int to char but that seemed inefficient
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- remembering the code for string matching 
- I was too hung up on my initial proposed solution that I could not think of another *logical* approach
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- by starting from the back of the string, we can accurately determine the length of the number since it will start with a # rather than end with it 

```
## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp

```
