## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- use a hash map to store the character frequencies for target
- this feels like a greedy problem since we are going to be constantly searching for the lowest number of stickers to form our string
- DP may be useful here since we need a way of tracking overlapping uses of stickers since they can be reused
- maybe something that tracks for a given sticker, what chars it contains
