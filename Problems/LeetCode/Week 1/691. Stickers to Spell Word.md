## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
brute force: 
- use a hash map to store the character frequencies for target
- i think we can use .find() to find characters that we need in a given string
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- this feels like a greedy problem since we are going to be constantly searching for the lowest number of stickers to form our string
- DP may be useful here since we need a way of tracking overlapping uses of stickers since they can be reused
- maybe something that tracks for a given sticker, what chars it contains
