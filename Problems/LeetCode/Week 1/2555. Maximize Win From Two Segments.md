## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- use an unordered map to store the frequencis of numbers 
- iterate through the map to try and find the complement of k and num
- if an element exists then we assume that a "prize" can be won
- push it into a prizes vector
- return the last 2 elements in the vector
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- my above thoughts were incorrect
- iteration through the list to calculate prizes
- dealing with maximizng prizes with overlapping integers
- memorization and DP implementation
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
1. Sliding Window: use left and right pointers to maintain the range of positions within k. Adjust left while the range exceeds k

3. Count Prizes: use the diff between left and right to calculate the number of prizes in our window

4. Dynamic Programming: 
	- use a dp array to store the maximum number of prizes you can win up to a certain index
	- combine the current window's prizes with the maximum from a previous non-overlapping range

```
## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
	int maximizeWin(vector<int>& prizePositions, int k) {
		int n = prizePositions.size();
		int maxPrizes = 0;
		int left = 0;

		vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0); // store the max prizes up to index i
		
	}
};
```
