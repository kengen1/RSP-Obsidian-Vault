## üìù Problem Details

- **Title:** `2555. Maximize Win From Two Segments`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-win-from-two-segments/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Sliding-Window #Dynamic-Programming 

## üí≠What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- use an unordered map to store the frequencis of numbers 
- iterate through the map to try and find the complement of k and num
- if an element exists then we assume that a "prize" can be won
- push it into a prizes vector
- return the last 2 elements in the vector
```

## ü§îWhat Did I Struggle With?

```
- my above thoughts were incorrect
- iteration through the list to calculate prizes
- dealing with maximizng prizes with overlapping integers
- memorization and DP implementation
```

## üí° Explanation of Solution

```
1. Sliding Window: use left and right pointers to maintain the range of positions within k. Adjust left while the range exceeds k

3. Count Prizes: use the diff between left and right to calculate the number of prizes in our window

4. Dynamic Programming: 
	- use a dp array to store the maximum number of prizes you can win up to a certain index
	- combine the current window's prizes with the maximum from a previous non-overlapping range

```

## ‚åõ Complexity Analysis

```

## üíª Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
	int maximizeWin(vector<int>& prizePositions, int k) {
		int n = prizePositions.size();
		int maxPrizes = 0;
		int left = 0;

		vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0); // store the max prizes up to index i

		// sliding window to find maximum prizes in range 
		for(int right = 0; right < n; right ++) {
			// shrink the window if it exceeds size k
			while(prizePositions[right] - prizePositions[left] > k) left++;

			// calculate the number of prizes in the current node
			int prizesInWindow = right - left + 1;

			// update maxPrizes with best combination
			maxPrizes = max(maxPrizes, prizesInWindow + dp[left]);

			// store the maximum prizes up to the current index
			dp[right + 1] = max(dp[right], prizesInWindow);
		}
		return maxPrizes;
	}
};
