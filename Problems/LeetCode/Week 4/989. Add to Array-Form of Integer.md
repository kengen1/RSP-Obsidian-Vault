## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `989. Add to Array-Form of Integer`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/add-to-array-form-of-integer/
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Arrays #Math 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- convert each number in the array into a character and append the character into a string variable
- convert the string into an integer
- add k to the integer
- convert back into a string
- for each char in the string, push it into a results vector
- return the results vector

this works but encounters runtime errors with numbers that exceed integer max size or even long sizes
