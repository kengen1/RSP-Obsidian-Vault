- **Tags/Categories:** #Math #Modulo-Operator

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- how the modulo operator is used in this problem
	- used to determine if a number i is a divisor of another number n
	- n % i == 0 means that i can be divided by n evenly so it is a divisor of n
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- ensure input `num` is positive because perfect numbers are positive integers
- proper divisors of n are all numbers less than n that divide n evenly
- since divisors come in pairs 
	- (e.g., for n=28, divisors include 1-28, 2,14), you only need to iterate up to sqrt(n)
- as you find divisors, add them to a running total
- remember to exclude n itself
- if the sum of the proper divisors == n then its a perfect number
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPerfectNumber(int n) {
        if(n <= 1) return false;
        
        int divisorSum = 1; // start with 1 because it is always a divisor

        for(int i=2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
            if(n % i == 0) {
                divisorSum += i;
                if(i != n/i) {
                    divisorSum += n / i; // add the complementary divisor
                }
            }
        }
        return divisorSum == n;
    }
};
```
