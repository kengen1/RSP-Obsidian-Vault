## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `71. Simplify Path`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:**  #Strings #Stack 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- Use a stack to manage directory traversal since it allows us to go "up" a directory by popping from the stack
- Split the input path by '/' to process each component one by one
- Handle special cases like '.', '..', and empty strings resulting from consecutive '/'
- Rebuild the simplified path from the stack at the end
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- Properly handling edge cases like:
	- Extra slashes ('//')
	- Paths with only root '/' or '.' and '..' without any valid directories
- Efficiently constructing the final simplified path from the stack
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
1. split the input path
	- split the given string by the delimiter `/` to isolate directory names and commands (. , ..)

2. use a stack to manage directories
	- ignore empty or current directory (.)
	- skip elements that are empty (from consecutive slashes)
	- 
1. reconstruct the simplified path

2. edge cases
