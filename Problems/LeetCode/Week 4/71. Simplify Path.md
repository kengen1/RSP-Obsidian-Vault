## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `71. Simplify Path`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:**  #Strings #Stack 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- Use a stack to manage directory traversal since it allows us to go "up" a directory by popping from the stack
- Split the input path by '/' to process each component one by one
- Handle special cases like '.', '..', and empty strings resulting from consecutive '/'
- Rebuild the simplified path from the stack at the end
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- Properly handling edge cases like:
	- Extra slashes ('//')
	- Paths with only root '/' or '.' and '..' without any valid directories
- Efficiently constructing the final simplified path from the stack
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
1. split the input path
	- split the given string by the delimiter `/` to isolate directory names and commands (. , ..)

2. use a stack to manage directories
	- skip elements that are empty (from consecutive slashes)
	- or elements that represent the current directory (.)

3. reconstruct the simplified path
	- combine the elements in the stack using '/' as the separator to create the simplified absolute path
	- ensure the result starts with '/' as it represents the absolute path

4. edge cases
	- paths like `/../` should simplify to `/` as we cannot go above the root directory
	- paths with only `/` or `/./` should simplify `/`
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) due to auxilary space used for the stack
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution
