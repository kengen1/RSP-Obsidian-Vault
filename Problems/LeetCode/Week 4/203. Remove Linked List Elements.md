## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `203. Remove Linked List Elements`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/
- **Difficulty:**  #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Linked-List 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
similar to implemented solution with some missing logic 
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
forgot to delete / free up memory for removed nodes
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
- create a dummy node and initialize its values to 0, point its next to head
- create another list node curr that is equal to the dummy node

- traverse the list while curr->next is not null
	- if curr->next is equal to val
		- create a temp node that is equal to curr->next
		- make curr->next equal to curr->next->next
		- delete temp
	- else move to the next node 

- get rid of the dummy node by creating a newHead node equal to dummy->next
- delete dummy
- return the newHead
```
