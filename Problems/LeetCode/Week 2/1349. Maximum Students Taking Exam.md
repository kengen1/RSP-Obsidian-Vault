- **Difficulty:** #Hard 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Dynamic-Programming #Bit-Manipulation #Matrix #Bitmask

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
rules:
- cant have anyone to the left or right of them
- cant have anyone to the top-left or top-right of them 
- chair cannot be broken

- we need a way of remembering the positions of the previous row, to inform the placement of students in the current row
- the input size constraints are interesting
	- m and n cant be greater than 8
	- suggests the use of bit manipulation to flip student placement 

proposed algorithm design:
- for each row
	- check if the seat is broken or not
		- if it is, flip the bit to 0 (do nothing)
		- if it isnt broken continue
	- check if there are any students to the left or right of them (check the left and right bits and see if they are flipped to 1)
	- check the previous row and the same left and right positions for flipped bits
	- populate our bitmask with 8 bits flipping them if a student can be seated there
