## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
rules:
- cant have anyone to the left or right of them
- cant have anyone to the top-left or top-right of them 
- chair cannot be broken

- we need a way of remembering the positions of the previous row, to inform the placement of students in the current row
- the input size constraints are interesting
	- m and n cant be greater than 8
	- suggests the use of bit manipulation to flip student placement 

proposed algorithm design:
- for each row
	- check if the seat is broken or not
		- if it is, flip the bit to 0 (do nothing)
		- if it isnt broken continue
	- check if there are any students to the left or right of them (check the left and right bits and see if they are flipped to 1)
	- check the previous row and the same left and right positions for flipped bits
	- populate our bitmask with 8 bits flipping them if a student can be seated there
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- did not account for precomputing valid masks for each row
	- since we know that the number of permutations for a given rows student seating is small due to the size constraints, we can precompute valid masks and store them in a vector of integers, where each integer represents a single 8-bit mask
	- the above pre-computation should enable a dynamic programming solution that prevents the repetitive determination of a valid seating arrangement 
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
1. Precompute valid configurations
	- for each row, generate a bitmask representing which seats are available (1 for available, 0 for broken)
	- compute all possible configurations (bitmasks) for each row
		- ensure no two adjacent students are seated (no two bits can be flipped and next to eachother in the order of the bitmask)

2. Initialize the DP table
	- create a 2d DP table --> dp[row][mask] where:
		- row represents the current row 
		- mask is a bitmask representing the seating configuration for the current row
		- dp[row][mask] stores the maximum number of students that can be seated up to that row, given the configuration

3. Iterate over rows
	- for each row
		- iterate through all valid configurations (mask) for the current row
		- for each configuration
			- check compatibility with all valid configurations (prevMask) of the previous row
				- ensure no diagonal conflicts (no student in `mask` conflicts with the top-left or top-right position of `prevMask`)
			- update the dp table
			`dp[row][mask] = max(dp[row][mask], dp[row-1][prevMask] + numberOfStudentsIn(mask));`

4. Count students for each configuration
	- for each bitmask (mask), count the number of 1s (students seated) using bitwise operations

5. Find the maximum students:
	- after processing all rows, find the maximum value in the last row of the DP table

6. Return the result
```

TC:
