## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `438. Find All Anagrams in a String`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** `{{tags/categories}}`

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- create a copy of p that is sorted for comparison
- sliding window of size p
- iterate through s, assign the values of our substring inside the window
	- sort that string
	- check if it is equal to p sorted
	- if it is, push the inde for the left pointer of the window into the vector
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- this works but is quite inefficient
	- O((n-k) * k log k) space complexity
```

# Inefficient Solution
## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
1. frequency arrays
	- pFreq to keep track of character frequencies in p
	- windowFreq to keep track of the character frequencies in our current window

2. sliding window 
	- add the character at the right index to windowFreq
	- if the window size exceeds p.size() remove the character at the left index from windowFreq and increment left

3. comparison
4.
