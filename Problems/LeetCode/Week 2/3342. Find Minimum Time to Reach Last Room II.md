## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- Dynamic Programming at first glance
- Upon additional reading, the question quite clearly outlines the need for a "shortest path"
	- Looks like the solution will involve using something like Dijkstras on our grid
- The question constraints also indicate that we need something in logarithmic time, as the length of n or m can be at most 750. 
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- employing dijkstras in a matrix 
- logic for adjacent directional movement
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
State Representation: Use Dijkstra's on a graph where each node corresponds to a state (row,col, parity)
- row,col are the coordinates of the cel
- parity indicates whether the next step will code 1 or 2 seconds
	- parity = 0 => next step costs 1
	- parity = 1 => next step costs 2

- We are at (0,0) at time 0, and the first step we take will cost 1 second, so parity = 0


**Transition:** From `(r, c, parity)`, we can move to any adjacent cell `(nr, nc)` if it’s within bounds. The new time calculation:

1. Current time = dist[r][c][parity]
2. Wait if necessary: `start_move_time = max(dist[r][c][parity], moveTime[nr][nc])`
3. Step cost = `1` if parity = 0, else `2`
4. `arrival_time = start_move_time + step_cost`
5. The next parity = `1 - parity`

If `arrival_time < dist[nr][nc][1 - parity]`, then we have found a better time to reach `(nr, nc)` with the next step parity. Update and push into the priority queue.

**Termination:** When we pop from the priority queue and reach `(n-1, m-1)`, we can return the time associated. Alternatively, we continue until all states are processed and take the minimum of `dist[n-1][m-1][0]` and `dist[n-1][m-1][1]`. Since reaching the last cell means we've completed that last move, the popped state corresponding to `(n-1, m-1)` will have the correct minimum time.
