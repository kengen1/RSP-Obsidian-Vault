## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- Dynamic Programming at first glance
- Upon additional reading, the question quite clearly outlines the need for a "shortest path"
	- Looks like the solution will involve using something like Dijkstras on our grid
- The question constraints also indicate that we need something in logarithmic time, as the length of n or m can be at most 750. 
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- employing dijkstras in a matrix 
- logic for adjacent directional movement
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
State Representation: Use Dijkstra's on a graph where each node corresponds to a state (row,col, parity)
- row,col are the coordinates of the cel
- parity indicates whether the next step will code 1 or 2 seconds
	- parity = 0 => next step costs 1
	- parity = 1 => next step costs 2

- Start at (0,0) at time 0
```
