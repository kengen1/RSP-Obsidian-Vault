## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1652. Defuse the Bomb`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/defuse-the-bomb/
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- fixed sliding window 
- the sliding window needs to be maintained in the circular array
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- did not think to use the modulo operator to maintain the circular array
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
for k == 0, return a new array of size n with all values equal to 0
for k > 0, itearte from 1 to k and calculate (i + j) % n to sum the next k elements
for k < 0, iterate from 1 to abs(k) and calculate (i-j+n) % n to sum the previous k elements
handle negative modulo by adding n before applying %n to ensure positive indicies
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n * k) 
- for every element of n, we traversing k elements ahead or behind to calculate the sum

Space Complexity: O(n)
- 
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp

```
