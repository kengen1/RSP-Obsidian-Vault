## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1220. Count Vowels Permutation`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-vowels-permutation/
- **Difficulty:** #Hard 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Dynamic-Programming 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- the number of possible permutations grows exponentially with the length of the sequence n
- brute force would be to generate all possible vowel sequences of length n and check each sequence to see if it satisfies the given rules for valid transitions between vowels
- many sequences share the same suffix or prefix sequence 
- dynamic programming seems like the appropriate approach since we can store and reuse calculations for overlapping subproblems (sequences)
