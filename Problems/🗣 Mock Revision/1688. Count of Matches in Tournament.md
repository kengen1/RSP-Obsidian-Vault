## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1688. Count of Matches in Tournament`

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
The number of matches directly corresponds to the number of eliminations. Since one match eliminates one team, the total number of matches for nnn teams is 

Matches = n - 1

this formula holds regardless of whether n is even or odd
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
Tournament Simulation:
- If n is even:
	- All teams are paired into n/2 matches.
    - After these matches, n/2 teams advance.

- If n is odd:
    - (n−1)/2 matches are played with n−1 teams.
    - The remaining unpaired team automatically advances to the next round.

- Repeat until only one team remains.
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity:
- Simulation: O(log⁡n), as n halves in each iteration.
- Optimized: O(1), direct computation.

Space Complexity:
- Both approaches: O(1)
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        return n - 1;
    }
};
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        int matches = 0;
        while (n > 1) {
            if (n % 2 == 0) {
                matches += n / 2;
                n /= 2;
            } else {
                matches += (n - 1) / 2;
                n = (n - 1) / 2 + 1;
            }
        }
        return matches;
    }
};
```
