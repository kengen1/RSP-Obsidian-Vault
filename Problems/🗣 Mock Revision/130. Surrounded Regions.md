## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `130. Surrounded Regions`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Arrays #Matrix #DFS 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- use a DFS approach where we:
	- start at the first element in the matrix and either go down or right 
	- if the value is an X, go down 
		- once you cant go down any further on the Xs path, "recurse" up and try moving right do this until you encounter an 'O' 
		- if you encounter an O, check if its an edge element , if its not convert it to an X and continue
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
1. directionality
	- initial approach only goes down and right, missing potential Os in the up and left direction
	- this may cause incomplete exploration

2. edge connection
	- initial approach flips all encountered Os to Xs unless they're edge elements
	- an O connected to an edge O (even indirectly) should not be flipped

3. revisits and efficiency
	- without marking visited cells, the above approach might repeatedly explore the same cells
