- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Arrays #Matrix #DFS 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- use a DFS approach where we:
	- start at the first element in the matrix and either go down or right 
	- if the value is an X, go down 
		- once you cant go down any further on the Xs path, "recurse" up and try moving right do this until you encounter an 'O' 
		- if you encounter an O, check if its an edge element , if its not convert it to an X and continue
