## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `2116. Check if a Parentheses String Can Be Valid`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-parentheses-string-can-be-valid/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Stack 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- use a stack to keep track of open brackets
- iterate through the string
- check if the current char is an opening bracket
	- if it is, push it to the stack 
	- if it isnt, try and pop from the stack
		- if there is nothing in the stack, check if the bracket can be flipped (in locked array)
		- if it can, flip it to an open bracket and push it into the stack 
		- if not, return false

- return true or false if the stack is empty or not 
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
Two Stack Approach:
1. Open parentheses `(` indices
2. Wildcard `*` indices
--------------------------------------

1. initialize two empty stacks

2. traverese the string from left to right 
	- when encountering an (:
		- push its index into `open_stack`
	- when encountering a *:
		- push its index into `star_stack`
	- when encountering a `)`:
		- first try to balance it with an ( by popping from `open_stack`
		- if open_stack is empty, try to balance it with a * by popping from `star_stack`
		- if both stacks are empty, the string cannot be valid

2. after the traversal, handle any left over `(`:
	- use the remaining `*` in `star_stack` to balance the unmatched `(` in `open_stack`
	- match the indices of `*` and `(` such that each `*` occurs after its matching `(` (because the order matters)

3. If there are still unmatched `(` after using all `*`, return false
	- otherwise, return true


```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n)
- traversal of the string from left to right
- stack operations are constant in time 

Space Complexity: O(n)
- use of both the open and star stacks containing a worst case of n elements

```
