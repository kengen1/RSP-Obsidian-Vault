## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `1725. Number of Rectangles That Can Form The Largest Square`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-rectangles-that-can-form-the-largest-square/
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Arrays 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- take the minimum element between the length and width for each rectangle, which will form a square
- record the max of the above elements as we iterate thorugh the array
- have a counter for every instance of the maxElement
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
got this quickly in the interview
```

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
same as intuition
```

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countGoodRectangles(vector<vector<int>>& rectangles) {
        int maxSquare = INT_MIN;
        int counter = 0; 
        for(auto rectangle : rectangles) {
            int possibleSquare = min(rectangle[0], rectangle[1]);

            if(possibleSquare > maxSquare) {
                maxSquare = possibleSquare;
                counter = 1;
            }
            else if(possibleSquare == maxSquare)
                counter++;
        }

        return counter;
    }
};
