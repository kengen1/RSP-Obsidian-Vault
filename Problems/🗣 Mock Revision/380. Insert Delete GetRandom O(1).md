## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- design question 
- can use a hashmap for O(1) insertion and deletion
- retrieving a random element from the map is a little tricky 
	- can possibly use a vector that stores indices of elements
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- ran out of time to convert pseudo code to actual code during the mock interview
- probably wouldve ran into issues with removal of elements in the vector alongside the map
