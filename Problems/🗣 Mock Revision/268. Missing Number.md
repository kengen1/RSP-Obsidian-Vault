## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `268. Missing Number`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/
- **Difficulty:** #Easy 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Math #Arrays 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- array is not sorted 
- if we sort the array, then check that the current index and the next index dont differ by 1, then we continue
- if it doesnt, then we know thats the element to return 

- came up with the idea that we can sum all the elements in the array, and create a separate sum for all numbers in the range of the starting number and n, return the diff between the two

## 💡 Explanation of Solution

```
both of the inutitions work

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Sorting Approach:
	Time Complexity: O(n log n)
	Space Complexity: O(1) if we use the sort array

Math Approach:
	Time Complexity: O(n)
	Space Complexity: O(1)
```
