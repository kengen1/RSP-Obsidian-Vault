## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `61. Rotate List`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Linked-List #Math 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- interate through the list with an iterator node
- cumulate the length of the list

- use the list and k value to compute k%n which is the condensed number of k rotations
```

## 🤔What Did I Struggle With?

```
- took me a while to solidify the above approach
- ran out of time 
- probably would've had issues with cutting the tail of the previous tail node that will be moved to the head
