## 📝 Problem Details

- **Title:** `853. Car Fleet`
- **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/
- **Difficulty:** #Medium 
- **Tags/Categories:** #Stack #Monotonic-Stack #Sorting 

## 💭What Were My Initial Thoughts?

```
- we will need to store the position and speed values in a vector of pairs to ensure they are coupled
- sorting the paired elements by their starting positions 
- start from the back of the array first (the last position)
	- calculate the time it takes a car at position i to get to target
	- compare that value to the next value 
	- if the next value has a shorter time , remove that value from the stack as its now apart from the fleet in front of it 
	- return the size of the stack 
```
