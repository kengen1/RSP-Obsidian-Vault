## 🔍 Problem Understanding

Design a class for a stack data structure that supports the following operations:
- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

**Constraint**: each function cannot exceed a time complexity of O(1)

## 🎯 Key Insights

```
- the challenge of this problem lies in the `getMin()` function, as this is something that is fundamentally in conflict with the way a traditional stack data structure operates

- elements should be placed in the stack, in order of insertion, but we also need a way to keep track of the minimum element inside that stack at any given time
	- a brute force (unacceptable) approach could be to convert the stack into a vector, sort it, and return the first element
	- the above approach would be O(n log n) in time and O(n) additional space
