## 🔍 Problem Understanding

Given a string of tokens, containing integers and valid operators (`+` , `-` , `*` , `/`), return the integer that represents the value of the expression in tokens

*For example:*
**Input:** tokens =` ["2","1","+","3","*"]`
**Output:** `9`
**Explanation:** `((2 + 1) * 3) = 9`

## 🎯 Key Insights

```
- the values are strings, so we will need to convert numbers to integers before performing any operations
- to perform any given operation, we require 2 integers
- we can use a stack to store elements until we encounter an operand, upon which we conduct the operations of the integers and push it back into the stack and continue
- we should end up with a single value by the end of this process
