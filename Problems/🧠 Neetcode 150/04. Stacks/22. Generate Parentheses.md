## 🎯 Key Insights

```
- this is a permutation / combinatorics question 
- was initially unsure how a stack could be used to solve this problem
- instead of an explicit stack datastructure, we can employ the call stack through recursion to do are computation of permutations 
- this is a "backtracking" / dynamic programming question
