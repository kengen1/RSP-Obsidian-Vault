## 🔍 Problem Understanding

*Given a list of daily temperatures, the task is to calculate how many days you have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day with a warmer temperature, the output for that day should be `0`.*

---

## 🎯 Key Insights

```
- using a stack is helpful to keep track of indicies of temperatures that haven't yet found a warmer day
```

---

## 🔑 Approach

- **Iterate Through the List:**
    - Use a stack to store pairs `(index, temperature)` where the temperature is waiting for a warmer day.

- **Process Stack Elements:**
    - If the current temperature is higher than the temperature on top of the stack, calculate the difference in days and store it in the result array.
    - Continue popping the stack while this condition holds.

- **Push Current Day:**    
    - Push the current day and its temperature onto the stack.

- **Final Result:**
    - For any remaining indices in the stack, there are no warmer days, so their result remains `0`.

## ⌛ Complexity Analysis

```
Time Complexity: O(n)
	- each temperature is pushed and popped from the stack at most once
	- we are also iterating n times through the temperatures array

Space Complexity: O(n)
	- in the worst case all temperatures might be stored in the stack 
```

## 💻 Implementation of Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& temperatures) {
        int n = temperatures.size();
        stack<pair<int,int>> stk;
        vector<int> result(n);

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            int currDay = i;
            int currTemp = temperatures[i];

            while(!stk.empty() && stk.top().second < currTemp){
                int prevDay = stk.top().first;
                int prevTemp = stk.top().second;
                stk.pop();
                result[prevDay] = currDay - prevDay;
            }

            stk.push({currDay, currTemp});
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
