# Stacks and Queues

- stack use cases in recursive algorithms 
    - the process of pushing temporary data onto a stack as your recurse, but then remove them as you backtrack 
- stacks can be used to implement recursive algorithms iteratively (since we can immitate the call stack)
- common applications in BFS and cache implementation

- general trends and tips for identifying or solving queue/stack related problems
