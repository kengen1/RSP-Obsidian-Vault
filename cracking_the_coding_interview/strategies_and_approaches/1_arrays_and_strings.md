# 1. Arrays and Strings

- array and string questions being interchangable
- hashtables and collision resolution (the chapter mentions building its own hash table with an array of linked lists)
    - how is this abstracted in C++ with its STL
- difference between arrays and vectors in C++
    - how do resizable arrays (vectors) work and their time complexity
- the benefit of string builders (string stream in C++) context
    - joinWords example of having to create a new copy of the string upon concatenation
- practice exercises: implement your own version of StringBuilder, Hashtable and ArrayList

- general tips for solving array / list questions 
- two pointer / sliding window techniques 
    - their use cases (pair-finding, merging sorted arrays, subarray searches)

- benefit of std::reverse and its time complexity
- using a fixed size array for counting characters (128 for ASCII) for permutation checks
- bit manipulation use in string / array questions
- std::string::find for search and checking rotations by concatenating the string with itself (and its time complexity)
