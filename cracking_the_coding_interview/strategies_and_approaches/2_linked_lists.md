# Linked Lists

- mention how its a contiguous data structure (compared to the linear structure of arrays and strings)
- the benefit of a linked list (adding and removing items from the beginning of a list in constant time)
- the runner technique (fast and slow pointers)
- the use of recursion to solve linked list problems
    - recursive algorithms take at least O(N) space due to the recursive call stack
    - all recursive algorithms can be implemented iteratively, although this may cause the implementation to become more complex

- general trends and tips for solving linked list problems
