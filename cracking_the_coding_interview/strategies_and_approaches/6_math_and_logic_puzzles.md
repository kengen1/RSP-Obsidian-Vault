# Math and Logic Puzzles
- common topics for math and logic puzzles:
    - prime numbers (divisibility, checking primality, generating a list of primes)
    - probability (AND / OR, independence, mutual exclusivity)

- break a problem down to its simplest form
- write down "rules" or patterns that you discover while solving the problem
- most brainteaser problems are worded either in terms of minimizing an action or in doing something at most a specific number of times
- balance the worst case 
- if you're stuck, consider taking an algorithmic approach 
- brainteasers are often nothing more than algorithm questions with the technical aspects removed
