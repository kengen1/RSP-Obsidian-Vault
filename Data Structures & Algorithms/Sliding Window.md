## 1. Overview

- Uses #Two-Pointers  to define a "window" over a dataset
-  Reduces complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) in many cases
- Two types:
	- Fixed-size window: Window size remains constant
	- Variable-size window: Window size adjust dynamically

* Commonly used when we need to find subarrays or substrings according to a given set of conditions
