### Object-Oriented Design (OOD): Key Insights

#### Step 1: Handle Ambiguity
- OOD questions are often intentionally vague to test your ability to clarify requirements.
- **Ask Clarifying Questions**:
  - Use "who, what, when, where, why, how" to define complexity and scope.
  - Avoid making assumptions; probe for details about the system's functionality and constraints.

---

#### Step 2: Define Core Objects
- Identify the primary components of the system.
- Example for a restaurant system:
  - Objects: `Table`, `Guest`, `Party`, `Order`, `Meal`, `Employee`, `Server`, `Host`.

---

#### Step 3: Analyze Relationships
- Determine how objects relate to one another:
  - Which objects are members of other objects?
  - Do any objects inherit from others?
  - Are relationships one-to-many or many-to-many?

---

#### Step 4: Investigate Actions
- Identify the key actions each object will perform and how they interact.
- Translate these actions into methods for the respective objects.

### Common Design Patterns

#### Singleton
- **Purpose:** Ensures a class has only one instance, accessible globally.
- **Drawbacks:** Often considered an "anti-pattern" as it can complicate unit testing and introduce hidden dependencies.

#### Factory Method
- **Purpose:** Provides a way to create an instance of a class, letting subclasses decide which specific class to instantiate.
- **Benefit:** Promotes flexibility and reduces coupling between objects.
