#Stack [[Queue]]
#### Stacks: Use Cases in Recursive Algorithms
- **Temporary Data Storage:** 
  - Push temporary data onto the stack during recursion and pop it off as you backtrack.
  - Example: Depth-first search (DFS), backtracking problems (e.g., maze solving, N-Queens).

- **Imitating Recursion:**
  - Stacks can replace recursion by mimicking the call stack.
  - Example: Converting recursive DFS into an iterative implementation.

#### Queues: Use Cases in Iterative Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
  - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level in graph or tree traversal.
  
- **Cache Implementation:**
  - Queues (or dequeues) are used in algorithms like Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

### General Trends and Tips for Stacks and Queues
1. **Stack Problems:**
   - Often involve last-in, first-out (LIFO) behavior.
   - Common tasks:
     - Evaluating expressions (e.g., postfix or infix conversion).
     - Validating parentheses or syntax.
     - Undo functionality.

2. **Queue Problems:**
   - Typically follow first-in, first-out (FIFO) behavior.
   - Common tasks:
     - Task scheduling.
     - Level-order traversal in trees (BFS).
     - Managing resource requests in real-time systems.

3. **Identify Problem Types:**
   - Look for patterns like:
     - Recursive problems → May use stacks.
     - Sequential processing → Likely involves queues.

4. **Optimize for Edge Cases:**
   - Empty queues or stacks.
   - Overflow or underflow scenarios.

5. **Leverage Data Structures:**
   - For stacks: Use `std::stack` in C++.
   - For queues: Use `std::queue` or `std::deque` in C++ for more flexibility.

6. **Visualize the Process:**
   - Draw diagrams for stack or queue operations to avoid off-by-one errors.
