- De-Normalized Database:
    - designed to minimize redundancy

- Normalized Database: 
    - designed to optimize read time


Approaching Small Database Design:
1. Handle Ambiguity : database questions are often ambiguous by design in order to probe your reasoning your information gathering skills
2. Define the Core Objects: each core object associated with a system can be translated into a table in our database
3. Analyze Relationships: How do our core objects relate to each other? Are they many-to-many? Or one-to-many?
4. Investigate Actions: walk through common use cases and actions taken by users to understand how to store and retrieve data

Approaching Large Database Design:
- in large databases, joins are generally slow
- de-normalizing data for large databases can be useful
