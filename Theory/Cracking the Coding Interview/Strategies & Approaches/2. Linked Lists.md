[[Linked List]]
#### Linked Lists as a Data Structure
- Linked lists are a **contiguous data structure**, unlike arrays and strings, which are linear structures.
- Each element (node) contains a value and a pointer/reference to the next node.

---

### Benefits of Linked Lists
- Efficient **insertions and deletions**:
  - Adding or removing items from the beginning of a list is **O(1)**.
  - Avoids the need for shifting elements, unlike arrays.

### The Runner Technique (Fast and Slow Pointers)
- Commonly used for problems such as:
  - Detecting cycles in a linked list.
  - Finding the middle element.
  - Removing the nth node from the end.
- Involves two pointers:
  - **Fast pointer:** Moves two steps at a time.
  - **Slow pointer:** Moves one step at a time.

### Solving Linked List Problems with Recursion
- Recursion provides a clean way to solve problems like:
  - Reversing a linked list.
  - Detecting palindromes.
  - Merging sorted linked lists.

- **Drawbacks of Recursion:**
  - Uses **O(N)** space due to the recursive call stack.
  - Recursive solutions can be converted to iterative solutions for better space efficiency, but this may increase code complexity.

### General Tips for Solving Linked List Problems
1. **Understand the Node Structure:**
   - Each node typically contains `value` and `next` fields.
   - For doubly linked lists, nodes also have a `prev` field.

2. **Plan Pointer Manipulation Carefully:**
   - Visualize pointer movements to avoid errors like losing a reference to a node.

3. **Use Dummy Nodes for Simplicity:**
   - Simplifies edge cases (e.g., modifying the head node).

4. **Break Down Problems into Smaller Steps:**
   - Handle individual tasks like traversing the list, reversing pointers, or updating node connections.

5. **Leverage Two Pointers or Recursion:**
   - Two-pointer techniques and recursion are common tools for efficient solutions.

### General Trends in Linked List Problems
- Many problems involve **traversing the list** while modifying pointers or creating new lists.
- Key operations to master:
  - Reversing a list.
  - Merging or splitting lists.
  - Detecting cycles.
- Always consider edge cases like:
  - Empty lists.
  - Single-node lists.
  - Lists with cycles.
