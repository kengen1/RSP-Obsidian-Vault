### Problem-Solving Strategies
1. **Simplify the Problem:**
   - Break the problem into its simplest form.
   - Focus on the core logic or math behind it.

2. **Discover Patterns:**
   - Write down rules or patterns that emerge as you analyze the problem.

3. **Consider Worst-Case Scenarios:**
   - Balance edge cases or worst-case outcomes to ensure robustness.

4. **Algorithmic Thinking:**
   - If stuck, take an algorithmic approach to break the problem into steps.

### Key Insights on Brainteasers
- Many puzzles involve minimizing actions or limiting the number of attempts.
- Brainteasers often disguise algorithmic problems by removing technical details.
- Approach them as algorithm questions: define inputs, outputs, and constraints.
