#### Clarify Tree Assumptions
- Avoid making ambiguous assumptions about the tree type:
  - **Tree vs. Binary Tree:** A general tree may have any number of children, while a binary tree has at most two children per node.
  - **Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree (BST):** A BST enforces the left child < parent < right child property.
  - **Balanced vs. Unbalanced Trees:** Balanced trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black) maintain height balance, while unbalanced trees may have large height differences.
  - **Complete, Full, and Perfect Trees:**
    - Complete: All levels filled except possibly the last, filled left to right.
    - Full: Every node has 0 or 2 children.
    - Perfect: All leaves are at the same level, and every internal node has 2 children.

### Traversal Types
- **In-Order Traversal:** Most common for BST-related problems (e.g., retrieving sorted values).
- **Pre-Order Traversal:** Used for creating copies of a tree or for prefix expressions.
- **Post-Order Traversal:** Common in problems requiring deletion of nodes or postfix expressions.
- **Level-Order Traversal (BFS):** Used for tasks involving breadth-first exploration (e.g., finding the width of a tree).

### Binary Heaps
- **Identifying Heap Questions:**
  - Look for problems involving repeated min/max operations or priority queues.
- **Implementation Insights:**
  - Binary heaps are often implemented as arrays.
  - Parent-child relationships:
    - Parent at `i`, children at `2i + 1` (left) and `2i + 2` (right).

### Tries (Prefix Trees)
- **Key Properties:**
  - A type of n-ary tree storing characters (1-26 for English alphabets).
  - Each path from the root to a node represents a prefix of a word.

- **Why Tries?**
  - Unlike hash tables, tries efficiently check if a string is a valid prefix.
  - Used in problems requiring repeated prefix lookups (e.g., autocomplete, word search).

- **Common Use Cases:**
  - Problems involving lists of valid words.
  - Searching through related prefixes repeatedly (e.g., "M", "MA", "MAN", "MANY").

### Graphs: Key Insights

#### DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Preferred for visiting every node due to its simple implementation.
- Suitable for problems like:
  - Detecting cycles.
  - Exploring all connected components.

#### BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Generally better for:
  - Finding the shortest path or any path between two nodes.
  - Level-order exploration of nodes.

- **Key Implementation Detail:**
  - Use a **queue** to store nodes at the current level.

---

### Bidirectional Search
- **How It Works:**
  - Runs two BFS searches, one from the source and one from the destination node.
  - The search completes when the paths from both searches meet.

- **Key Considerations:**
  - Behavior differs on directed vs. undirected graphs.
  - Faster than traditional BFS in large graphs, as the search space grows slower with two simultaneous searches.

- **When to Use:**
  - Use **traditional BFS** for single-direction traversal or when the graph is small.
  - Use **bidirectional search** when source and destination are well-defined, and the graph is large.
