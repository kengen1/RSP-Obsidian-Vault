[[Bit Manipulation]]
#### General Use
- Bit manipulation is used in a variety of problems:
  - Sometimes explicitly required by the question.
  - Other times it's a useful technique for optimizing solutions.

### Bit Facts and Tricks
- Useful expressions in bit manipulation:
  - `x ^ 0s = x` (XOR with 0s leaves bits unchanged)
  - `x ^ 1s = ~x` (XOR with 1s flips bits)
  - `x ^ x = 0` (XOR of identical bits cancels out)
  - `x & 0s = 0` (AND with 0s clears bits)
  - `x & 1s = x` (AND with 1s leaves bits unchanged)
  - `x & x = x` (AND of identical bits remains the same)
  - `x | 0s = x` (OR with 0s leaves bits unchanged)
  - `x | 1s = 1s` (OR with 1s sets bits to 1)
  - `x | x = x` (OR of identical bits remains the same)

- **Bit-by-Bit Operations:**
  - Operations occur on each bit independently.
  - If a rule applies to a single bit, it applies to all bits in the sequence.

### Two's Complement and Negative Numbers
- Two's complement is the standard representation for signed integers.
  - Positive numbers and 0 are represented as usual.
  - Negative numbers are represented by flipping all bits of the positive equivalent and adding 1.
- Bit manipulation tasks often rely on this representation for signed integers.

### Arithmetic vs. Logical Right Shifts
- **Arithmetic Right Shift (`>>` in most languages):**
  - Preserves the sign bit for signed numbers.
  - Useful for dividing signed numbers by powers of 2.

- **Logical Right Shift (`>>>` in most languages):**
  - Shifts bits to the right and fills with 0s.
  - Does not preserve the sign bit, so it's used for unsigned numbers.

### Common Bit Tasks
1. **Get a Bit:**
   - Check if the ith bit is set:
     - `(x >> i) & 1`

2. **Set a Bit:**
   - Set the ith bit to 1:
     - `x | (1 << i)`

3. **Clear a Bit:**
   - Clear the ith bit (set it to 0):
     - `x & ~(1 << i)`

4. **Update a Bit:**
   - Set the ith bit to a specific value (`v` is 0 or 1):
     - `x = (x & ~(1 << i)) | (v << i)`

### Key Tips
- Understand why each bit trick works instead of memorizing them.
- Practice visualizing binary numbers and common bit operations.
- Bit manipulation is particularly powerful in problems involving:
  - Flags.
  - Subset generation.
  - Optimizing space or runtime for algorithms.
