#Arrays #Strings 
#### Arrays vs. Strings:
- Array and string questions are often interchangeable because strings are arrays of characters.
- Analyze the problem: Could the solution for an array problem apply to strings, and vice versa?

### Hash Tables and Collision Resolution
- **Building a Hash Table:**
  - Use an array of linked lists to handle collisions via chaining.
  - Hash function maps keys to indices; collisions occur when keys map to the same index.

- **C++ STL Implementation:**
  - `std::unordered_map` abstracts hash tables.
  - Uses open addressing or chaining for collision resolution.

### Arrays vs. Vectors in C++
- **Key Differences:**
  - Arrays: Fixed size, contiguous memory, no dynamic resizing.
  - Vectors (`std::vector`): Resizable, manages memory automatically.

- **Resizable Array Mechanics:**
  - Doubles its capacity when resizing is needed.
  - Amortized time complexity for `push_back`: **O(1)** (due to infrequent resizing).

### String Builders (String Stream in C++)
- **Why Use String Builders?**
  - Concatenating strings repeatedly creates new copies, increasing memory and time costs.
  - String builders avoid these overheads by appending directly to a buffer.

- **Example: joinWords Problem:**
  - Direct concatenation (e.g., `word1 + word2 + word3`) creates multiple temporary strings.
  - Using `std::ostringstream` (string stream) builds the final string more efficiently.

### Practice Exercises
1. Implement your own **StringBuilder** using a dynamic buffer.
2. Create a custom **Hash Table** using an array of linked lists for collision resolution.
3. Build an **ArrayList** with dynamic resizing.

### Tips for Solving Array/List Questions
1. Understand the problem constraints (e.g., fixed size vs. dynamic size).
2. Use helper data structures like hash tables or fixed-size arrays for optimizations.
3. Break the problem into logical steps (e.g., iterate, transform, aggregate).

### Two Pointer / Sliding Window Techniques
- **Common Use Cases:**
  - **Pair-Finding:** Identify pairs in a sorted array with a target sum.
  - **Merging Sorted Arrays:** Traverse both arrays with two pointers.
  - **Subarray Searches:** Find subarrays with specific properties (e.g., max sum, target sum).

- **Why Use These Techniques?**
  - Efficient for linear time complexity (**O(n)**) solutions.

---

### Benefits of `std::reverse`
- Reverses elements in-place.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n).

---

### Counting Characters with Fixed-Size Arrays
- Use an array of size 128 (for ASCII) to count character frequencies.
- Efficient for problems like permutation checks or character frequency analysis.

---

### Bit Manipulation in String/Array Questions
- **Example Use Cases:**
  - Check unique characters in a string using bit masks.
  - Represent subsets of arrays with bit masks for efficient comparison.

---

### `std::string::find` for Searches
- **Common Usage:**
  - Check substring existence.
  - Verify rotations by concatenating a string with itself and using `find`.

- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)** for substring searches in typical cases.

---

### General Takeaways
- Focus on problem-specific optimizations (e.g., hash tables for lookups, string builders for concatenations).
- Understand the trade-offs between arrays and dynamic data structures.
- Leverage C++ STL functions for simplicity but know their underlying complexities.
