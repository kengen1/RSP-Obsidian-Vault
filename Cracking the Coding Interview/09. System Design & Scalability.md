#Design 
#### Step 1: Scope the Problem
- **Define Core Requirements:**
  - Clarify the problem and confirm what you're being asked to design.
- **Identify Key Features:**
  - Break down major use cases or functions (e.g., for a TinyURL service: URL shortening, retrieval, analytics).
- **Clarify Optional Details:**
  - Ask about customization (e.g., user-defined URLs), data persistence (e.g., expiration), and extra features (e.g., user accounts).
- **List Key Use Cases:**
  - Outline user actions to structure the design around real-world usage.

---

#### Step 2: Make Reasonable Assumptions
- **It's Okay to Assume:**
  - Make educated guesses about scale, usage, and constraints (e.g., supporting 1 million URLs per day).
- **Discuss and Confirm:**
  - Share your thought process and verify assumptions with the interviewer.

---

#### Step 3: Draw the Major Components
- **Utilize the Whiteboard:**
  - Sketch a diagram showing the systemâ€™s components.
- **Walk Through the Flow:**
  - Explain end-to-end actions using user scenarios (e.g., what happens when a user submits a new URL?).

---

#### Step 4: Identify the Key Issues
- **Analyze Bottlenecks:**
  - Consider potential scalability, latency, or reliability challenges.
- **Take Interviewer Feedback:**
  - Listen for hints or guidance during this step.

---

#### Step 5: Redesign for Key Issues
- **Address Constraints:**
  - Adjust your design to handle the bottlenecks or challenges identified.
- **Be Open About Limitations:**
  - Acknowledge known issues and communicate possible tradeoffs.

### Key Concepts

#### Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling
- **Vertical Scaling:** Add resources to a single node (e.g., more memory).
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more nodes and distribute the load.

#### Load Balancer
- Distributes traffic across servers to prevent overload.
- Requires a network of cloned servers with identical code and data access.

#### Database Optimization
- **Denormalization:** Add redundant data to speed up reads (e.g., avoid joins).
- **NoSQL Databases:** Scale better for unstructured data, no table joins.
- **Partitioning (Sharding):**
  - Vertical: Split by feature (e.g., profiles vs. messages).
  - Key-Based: Partition using a hash of the data.
  - Directory-Based: Use a lookup table to locate data.

#### Caching
- **In-Memory Cache:** Store frequently accessed data for quick retrieval.
- **Cache First:** Application checks the cache before querying the data store.

#### Asynchronous Processing
- Execute slow operations asynchronously using queues to improve performance.

---

### Network Metrics
- **Bandwidth:** Maximum data transfer rate (e.g., bits per second).
- **Throughput:** Actual data transferred.
- **Latency:** Time taken for data to travel from source to destination.

---

### MapReduce
- **Map:** Emits `<key, value>` pairs from data.
- **Reduce:** Combines values for a given key recursively.

---

### Design Considerations
- **Failures:** Design for handling component failures (e.g., fallback mechanisms).
- **Availability and Reliability:**
  - **Availability:** Percent of time the system is operational.
  - **Reliability:** Probability the system stays operational over time.
- **Read-Heavy vs. Write-Heavy:**
  - Read-heavy: Consider caching.
  - Write-heavy: Consider queuing writes (handle potential failure).
- **Security:** Anticipate and mitigate security risks.
